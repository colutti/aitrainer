- **Deep Integrations**:
  - **Hevy**: Import workouts in real-time via webhooks and create routines directly in Hevy.
  - **MyFitnessPal**: Sync nutrition data.
  - **Zepp Life/Xiaomi**: Import body composition from smart scales.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Development)

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker or Podman with a Compose-compatible CLI
- Node.js 22+ and Python 3.12+ only if you want to run app services outside containers

### 2. Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd personal

# Setup environment variables
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# (Edit .env with your LLM keys and credentials)

# Start the full stack with Podman Compose
make up

# Alternatively, run with rebuild
make debug-rebuild
```

### 3. Access
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Mongo Express**: http://localhost:8081

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

We maintain high quality standards with **TDD (Test Driven Development)** and strict linting.

### Official Test Path
The official stable way to run the full suite is containerized:

```bash
make test-once
```

This command runs backend, frontend, admin frontend, and Playwright E2E against real services on the same container network. It is the source of truth for local validation and CI.
The test stack also starts MongoDB, Qdrant, and `stripe-mock` as internal dependencies.

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                # Run unit/integration tests
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage (Thresholds: 70% branches, 85% functions, 88% lines)
npm run lint            # Zero warnings policy
npm run typecheck       # Strict TypeScript check
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pytest                  # Run all tests
pylint src              # Linting
pyright                 # Type checking
```

### Full Workflow
Use the provided automation for full verification:
`make test-once`

## 📐 Architecture Principles

1. **Feature Isolation**: Features in `frontend/src/features` are independent.
2. **Standardized CRUD**: Shared repositories and components for consistent data handling.
3. **Mock First**: Frontend tests always mock the backend for speed and isolation.
4. **Zero Tolerance**: 0 warnings or hints allowed in container logs, frontend, or backend.
